# An example of a web application that uses an API (Application Programming Interface) to get and display the most recent weather information for a specific location is a weather app. 

# The user-entered location or the user's present position, as accessible through GPS, may serve as the basis for this data. 

# The temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation information are typically included in the weather data.
